Description=AppDynamics Machine Agent

[Service]

# The AppDynamics machine agent startup script does not fork a process, so
# this is a simple service.
# Note: If you are changing the User running the machine agent, you must also ensure
# that the desired user has read access to controller-info.xml as well as write access
# to the log file. You can change specific file permissions or, most simply, do a
# chown command to give the desired user ownership of the MACHINE_AGENT_HOME directory.

# Specify agent system properties for systemd here by setting or editing JAVA_OPTS, e.g.,
#Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-D<sys-property1>=<value1> -D<sys-property2>=<value2>"

# Modify the next two lines to specify the user to run the machine agent as. Note that
# you will need to ensure that the controller-info.xml in the agent conf directory must
# be readable by this user, and that the logs directory is also writeable by that user.
